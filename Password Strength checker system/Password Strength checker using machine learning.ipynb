    "# Password Strength Checker \n",
    "It is an application that checks how strong a password is. Some popular password strength meters use machine learning algorithms to predict the strength of your password. So, if you want to learn how to use machine learning to check your passwordâ€™s strength, this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through how to create a password strength checker with machine learning using Python."

    "# How to Create a Password Strength Checker?\n",
    "A password strength checker works by understanding the combination of digits, letters, and special symbols you use in your password. It is created by training a machine learning model on a labelled dataset of different combinations of letters and special symbols people use in passwords. The model learns from data about what combinations of letters and symbols can be classified as a solid or weak password.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to create an application to check the strength of passwords, we need to have a labelled dataset about different combinations of letters and symbols. I found a dataset on Kaggle to train a machine learning model to predict the strength of a password. We can use that data for this task. You can download the dataset from here.\n",

A password strength checker works by understanding the combination of digits, letters, and special symbols you use in your password. I hope you liked this article on creating a passwordâ€™s strength checker with Machine Learning using Python. Feel free to ask valuable questions in the comments section below."
